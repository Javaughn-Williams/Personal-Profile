            <h3>Chapter 4</h3>
            <p>
                After reading “Achieve Your Goals,” I realized how important it is to clearly write down what I want to achieve 
                in life. Like Michael, I often have dreams and ambitions, but I don’t always plan how to reach them. Now, I see 
                that setting short-term, mid-term, and long-term goals can help me stay focused and organized. For example, I 
                can start by improving my grades this term, work on learning coding within a year, and aim to become a 
                professional game developer in the future. Writing these goals down gives me something real to work toward and 
                motivates me to keep going.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also learned that the real purpose of setting goals isn’t just to achieve something but to grow into a 
                better person along the way. Working toward my goals will help me develop discipline, patience, and confidence. 
                If I ever feel stuck, I can remind myself that even small changes in direction can make a big difference over 
                time. Like Charlie said, progress doesn’t happen overnight, but by staying consistent and reviewing my goals, 
                I can continue improving myself and getting closer to the life I want.

            <h3>Chapter 5</h3>
            <p>
                After reading “The Proper Use of Time,” I realized how often I let the urgent things in life; like schoolwork, 
                chores, or daily routines control my time instead of focusing on what truly matters. Charlie’s advice to 
                Michael made me think about how precious each day really is. Every day gives me many choices, but only one 
                best opportunity that moves me closer to my goals. I see now that if I don’t plan my time carefully, I’ll end 
                up just “getting by” instead of making real progress toward the life I want.
            </p>
            <p>
                This chapter also reminded me that discipline may be difficult, but the pain of regret is much worse. It made 
                me want to use my time more wisely by setting priorities that align with my goals and personal growth. I want to 
                stop wasting time on distractions and start being more intentional about how I spend each day. Like Charlie said, 
                I have to choose whether I will run the day or let the day run me, and I want to be the one in control of my time 
                and my future.

            <h3>Chapter 6</h3>
            <p>
                This chapter, “Surround Yourself With the Best People,” teaches that the people you spend time with play a huge 
                role in shaping your mindset, habits, and ultimately, your success. It shows that friends, coworkers, and even family 
                can either lift you up or hold you back depending on their attitudes and ambitions. Michael learns from Charlie that 
                if he keeps surrounding himself with people who complain, lack goals, or resist growth, he’ll slowly adopt those 
                same behaviors without realizing it. On the other hand, being around positive, motivated, and successful people can 
                inspire him to grow, think bigger, and work harder toward his dreams.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, this lesson reminds me to be more intentional about who I keep close. It encourages me to seek out people 
                who challenge me, believe in improvement, and want the best for themselves and others. I can apply this by spending 
                less time with negative influences and more time learning from people who motivate me; teachers, mentors, or even 
                friends who push me to do better in school or life. Like Michael, I realize that growth sometimes means letting go 
                of old habits and friendships that don’t align with where I want to go, and that’s okay because it opens space for 
                better, healthier influences.

            <h3>Chapter 7</h3>
            <p>
                This chapter, “Be a Life-Long Learner,” teaches that education doesn’t stop after school, it’s something we should 
                continue throughout our entire lives. Michael learns from Charlie that while formal education helps us make a living, 
                self-education is what we choose to learn on our own, what helps us truly grow and succeed. Reading books, learning 
                from others, and reflecting on personal experiences are powerful ways to keep improving. Charlie also reminds Michael 
                that not reading or seeking new knowledge limits our potential, while learning opens our minds to new ideas, opportunities, 
                and perspectives that can completely change our lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally, this chapter inspires me to take learning into my own hands instead of waiting for someone else to teach me. 
                It reminds me that growth comes from curiosity, whether it’s reading a book, asking questions, or learning from people 
                who have more experience. I can apply this by reading more often, exploring topics that interest me, and using mistakes 
                as lessons instead of failures. It shows me that success isn’t about knowing everything, but about never stopping the 
                process of learning.
