            <h2>Personality and Hobbies</h2>

            <h3>Playing Video Games</h3>
                <p> 
                    I have always enjoyed playing video games because they are not only entertaining but also a way 
                    to tackle challenges and explore meaningful stories. Through gaming, I have developed creativity, 
                    strategic thinking, and problem-solving skills. These traits help me approach school projects 
                    with innovative ideas and effective solutions. Additionally, gaming has strengthened my teamwork 
                    and communication skills, which improve collaboration in group assignments. While it can 
                    sometimes be distracting, I have learned to balance my gaming hobby with my academic responsibilities. 
                </p>
            

            <h3>Coding</h3>
                <p>
                    Coding is one of my favorite hobbies because it allows me to turn imagination into reality. It has 
                    helped me develop patience, attention to detail, and perseverance, all traits that are essential not 
                    only in programming but also in school. When facing challenging assignments, I approach them like 
                    a complex coding problem: breaking the task into smaller, manageable parts and systematically 
                    solving each one. This method improves my problem-solving skills and helps me stay organized and 
                    focused in my studies.
                </p>

            <h3>Watching Anime</h3>
                <p>
                    Watching anime is one of my hobbies that helps me relax and destress after a busy school day. It allows me 
                    to take a break, recharge, and clear my mind, which improves my focus and productivity when returning to 
                    schoolwork. It also serves as a way for me to bond with friends over shared interests and discussions. 
                    Additionally, anime inspires my creativity by giving me ideas for games I would love to bring to life in 
                    the future.

            <h2>Personal Motto</h2>

            <h3>Progress, not perfection</h3>
                <p> 
                    This motto reminds me to focus on continuous improvement rather than being overly critical of myself. In school and 
                    in my hobbies, like programming and game development, it’s easy to get discouraged when things aren’t perfect on 
                    the first try. This motto motivates me to take small steps, learn from mistakes, and celebrate every bit of progress 
                    I make. It helps me stay persistent, grow my skills, and maintain a positive mindset, even when challenges arise.

            <h2>Favourite Idea from "Top 20 Profitable AI Business Ideas in 2025"</h2>

            <h3>Application in My World:</h3>
            <p>
                As a full-time student who spends four to five hours commuting each day, I often 
                struggle to maintain a consistent fitness routine and healthy diet. Between 
                classes, assignments, and other responsibilities, it becomes easy to neglect my 
                physical well-being. Having a dedicated AI system to create personalized fitness 
                and nutrition plans would help me stay motivated and organized. The AI could 
                design workout schedules that fit my limited free time and suggest balanced meals 
                based on my preferences and budget. This would make it easier to stay healthy and 
                energized, even with a busy academic lifestyle.
            </p>


            <h3>Usefulness:</h3>
            <p>
                This approach offers several benefits:

                Time Efficiency: Automated plans save time in planning workouts and meals.

                Customization: Recommendations are tailored to individual health metrics and goals.

                Consistency: Structured plans encourage regular adherence to fitness and nutrition routines.
            </p>

            
            <h3>Ethical Considerations:</h3> 
            <p>
                While AI can enhance personalized health plans, it raises concerns such as:

                <ul>Data Privacy: Sensitive health information must be securely handled.</ul>

                <ul>Bias in Algorithms: AI systems might perpetuate biases if not properly trained.</ul> 

                <ul>Over-reliance on Technology: Excessive dependence on AI could reduce human judgment in health decisions.</ul> 
            </p>

            
            <h3>Proposed Solutions:</h3> 
            <p>
                To address these ethical issues:

                <ul>Data Protection: Implement stringent data encryption and obtain explicit user consent.</ul> 

                <ul>Bias Mitigation: Regularly update and audit AI algorithms to ensure fairness and accuracy.</ul> 

                <ul>Human Oversight: Encourage users to consult healthcare professionals alongside AI recommendations.</ul>
